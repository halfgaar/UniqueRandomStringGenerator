# Unique Random String Generator

Proof of concept code to generate hundreds of millions unique random strings, provided the amount of permutations fit within a 64 bit int (although it doesn't actually check that currently).

Code was needed once, so is limited in GUI features. The multi threaded aspect of it was added for fun's sake, later.
